## Test variation within morphospace
What is causing high levels of allometry? Is it functional integration of the gnawing apparatus (mostly in the cranium-rostrum area)? If so, we would expect to see the cranium-rostrum to be the least variable across species compared to basicranium-cranium and basicranium-rostrum comparisons.
