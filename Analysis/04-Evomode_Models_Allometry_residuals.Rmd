# Plot PCAs for allometric and shape residual datasets
Plot PCAs for allometric shape and shape residual, provide coloration and pch symbols by locomotion and diet, and visualize changes in shape residual PCA when *Notomys* species are removed. These plots are relevant to the heatplots created in script 05 / shown in Figure 2. 

Creates multipanel Figure 1.

Compares morphospace similarity of the two datasets with Mantel tests and a correlation test.

Creates supplementary Figure 1, a screeplot of the the PCs for each dataset.

Produces shape residual data used in later analyses, stored in rda file 04.

### Load packages, functions, and data
Tree, mean shape, and metadata for phylogenetic analyses come from the allometry rodents script 04.

#How strong is the OU process - is it OK to use BM for analyses? Using reasoning and workflow from Artuso et al. 2022:
#For those modules following an OU process, we calculated the “rate of adaptation” parameter, α, and its associated “phylogenetic half-life” (t1/2), as given by the formula (Hansen 1997, 2014): t1/2 = ln2/α, assuming a tree height of about 11.5 million years (Myr), based on the crown age of Clade A (Gamisch et al. 2021; see also Fig. S1). Phylogenetic half-lives are usually interpreted as the average time it takes a species to evolve halfway from its ancestral state (here: module shape) toward the optimum (see also Artuso et al. 2021), thereby indicating the strength of the OU process acting on the species. When α is zero and/or t1/2 is larger relative to tree height, the OU model collapses to the BM model (Beaulieu et al. 2012; Cooper et al. 2016).

#This is alpha (based on summary(OU_shapefit)) - it is 0.13
alpha <- OU_shapefit$opt$par[2]

#The deepest node is 37 but t1/2 is calculated as 5.28, so the OU model is not particularly BM-like 
max(node.depth(aus.tree))

log(2)/alpha

#But with small sample sizes, Type I error rates are high and common likelihood tests such as AIC can be biased (cooper et al. 2016)


#Does it make much of a difference to the coordinates if we adjust for OU vs BM evolution? 

#trying to do what I would usually do if I ran pgls:
resid_BM <- arrayspecs(BM_shapefit$residuals, dim(mean.shapes)[[1]], 3)
#trying to do what I would usually do if I ran pgls:
resid_OU <- arrayspecs(OU_shapefit$residuals, dim(mean.shapes)[[1]], 3)

#The r-pls of these residuals is 1
two.b.pls(resid_BM, resid_OU)

  #Size is BM
